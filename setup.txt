To pair new client device:

Switches
- Turn on node and enter pairing mode
- Enter pairing mode on hub too
- Node will find hub on bluetooth and attempt to connect through its name/MAC Address
- Hub identifies node's MAC address through that
- User inputs topic name of this device on hub (e.g., room1/lights)
- This is stored in database and the device's MAC address is appended to the list of devices subscribed to that topic
- Hub sends WiFi credentials to node via bluetooth (need to encrypt in the future)
- Hub also sends topic name to node via bluetooth
- Setup script publishes to topic new_topic so that main hub script reads database and subscribes to anything new (and updates the front end)
- Hub then subscribes to room1/lights/status
- Node connects to the WiFi
- Node subscribes to room1/lights/task
